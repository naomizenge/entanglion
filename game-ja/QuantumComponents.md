# Quantum components

- **Physical Qubits**. When detected by orbital defenses, you may place each ship on any planet of your choosing in Centarious.
- **Qubit Interconnect**. At the start of your turn, you may exchange one engine card with the other player if your spaceships are orbiting the same planet. This exchange is not considered an action.
- **Dilution Refrigerator**. The extra mass of the Dilution Refrigerator puts a strain on your ship's engines. The number of engine cards you may keep in your hand is reduced to two. Discard one engine card upon retrieving the Dilution Refrigerator.
- **Quantum Gates**. When exchanging an engine card, draw two replacement cards, add one to your hand, and discard the other one.
- **Quantum Programming**. When navigating to a planet in Entanglion that does not contain a quantum component, your ships automatically bypass the orbital defenses.
- **Quantum Error Correction**. Add one to your roll when rolling the Entanglion die.
- **Control Infrastructure**. The microwave radiation emitted by the control infrastructure makes it easier for your ship to be detected. Subtract one from your roll when rolling the Entanglion die.
- **Magnetic Shielding**. You may re-roll the Entanglion die one more time whenever rolling the die. Ignore the result of the first roll.
